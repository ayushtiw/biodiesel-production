# Economic assessment of biodiesel production: Comparison of alkali and biocatalyst processes

-> The research paper titled "Economic assessment of biodiesel production: Comparison of alkali 
and biocatalyst processes" by Kenthorai Raman Jegannathan, Chan Eng-Seng, and Pogaku 
Ravindra examines the economic aspects of biodiesel production using different catalytic 
processes, specifically comparing alkali and biocatalyst methods. 

-> The research focuses on assessing the economic aspects of biodiesel production 
with an emphasis on three catalytic processes: alkali, soluble enzyme, and immobilized enzyme. 
These processes were considered in a batch mode of operation with a production capacity of 1000 tonnes.

-> The paper highlights the growing importance of biodiesel as an alternative to fossil fuels 
due to its environmental benefits and increasing global production. 

-> It also discusses the transition from chemical catalysts to enzymatic processes for 
biodiesel production,aiming to reduce pollution and simplify production processes.
